MacOS Menu Bar CPU Utilization Tool.

This tool I developed for monitoring CPU utilization.  It is far simpler than [iStat Menu](https://bjango.com/mac/istatmenus/).  I developed it long ago after [Menumeters](https://github.com/yujitach/MenuMeters) stopped working; when I developed it, I was not aware than Menumeters will be adapted or have been adapted to work on later versions of MacOS.

The tool only shows CPU utilization.

Hope you find it useful.
